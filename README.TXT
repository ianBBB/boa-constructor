- Boa Constructor -

This project aims to update the Boa Constructor IDE to operate with versions of Python and wxPython in common use at this time (they are Python 3.x and wxPython 4.2.x). The orignal Boa Constructor was written for earlier versions of Python and wxPython which are no longer supported. Boa underwent a major update when Python 2.7 was released. This work is to develop the next iteration of the software.

A description of Boa Constructor is given below in the original README, retained here for historic continuity. Please note that many of the features mentioned below do not yet work under Python 3 as this is still a work in progress. Despite this, I have added my versioning and copyright message.

Thanks for checking out Boa Constructor.

Boa aims to be a simple Delphi for wxPython.
It is an IDE for Python development including visual wxPython frame
design, object browsers, documentation generation, debugging,
source control (CVS, SVN) and much more.
The Boa IDE also integrates with other Python technologies like 
Distutils, Zope, PyChecker, BicycleRepairMain.

If you are new to Boa and wxPython, work through the Getting Started Guide
and Tutorial.

Look at Changes.txt for the latest improvements.
Look at Bugs.txt for info about problems & bugs.

P.S. The short name is Boa, *not* BOA. 
Boa is not an acronymn, it's the name of a huge Python ;)
